---------
Add the command stack: e.g. in the command mode if the key is not a part of known flow (e.g. w move by word), add those to a stack until we match some command or press esc. I should probably limit this by some amount of chars.
Display this stack on the status bar. Vim adds it to the message bar, but who cares.
Eventually, I'll probably merge status and message bars and remove color inversion.
---------
Implement forward/backward search.
---------
Return nullable from search so that we could show a status message that nothing is found.
---------
Convert search quiery to rx space, e.g if there are tabs
---------
TODO: figure out what is the most convenient way of scrolling when searching.
---------
There is something wrong with the boundary check on the bottom most row. Sometimes, I cannot move to the new row, sometimes, I get move one row past it.
---------
Handling text at editor prompt is a big ugly as all keys delete to the right.
We need to reuse the input handling logic with the rest of the editor. Make prompt just another row???
---------
We currently use all unprocessed control characters enter the normal mode. Use only escape for that, ignore others.
---------
Rewrite MessageBar properly using the string formatting.

---------
Fully switch to the new reader/writer API, do not use the oldreader 
---------
Figure out how to process multi-key commands with modifiers: e.g. 3w
